Sb5aq5HcS1A2,16,Sb5aq5HcS1A,"Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper, and her mama was a hippy
In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you got to pay when you break the panorama
She never knew that there was anything more than poor
What in the world does your company take me for?
Black bandanna, sweet Louisiana
Robbing on a bank in the state of Indiana
She's a runner
Rebel, and a stunner
On her merry way saying baby, watcha gonna?
Looking down the barrel of a hot metal forty-five
Just another way to survive
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
She's a lover, baby, and a fighter
Should've seen it coming when I got a little brighter
With a name like Dani California
Day was gonna come when I was gonna mourn ya
A little loaded, she was stealing another breath
I love my baby to death
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Who knew the other side of you?
Who knew that others died to prove?
Too true to say goodbye to you
Too true to say, say, say
Pushed the fader, gifted animator
One for the now, and eleven for the later
Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota man
Wasn't gunnin' for the quota
Down in the Badlands she was saving the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth
She's my priestess
I'm your priest
Yeah, yeah, yeah
California, rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California, show your teeth"

It's ridiculous to think we should deny that we have these thoughts. At one point or another I believe most people have thought about it. To face it is to speak the unspoken. If it's a human experience, we should be able to talk about it. You are not alone.”"

FxzBvqY5PP02,59,FxzBvqY5PP0,"I was driving to Barnes Station in West London to get a train to Putney Station on early Tuesday Morning to go to Work because I work there every week on the Gateline. On the way driving down there, i was listening to BBC Radio 1 and this track by Daft Punk was playing and it really started my day very well. Normally, I work at Putney Station in the afternoons and evenings but this week, I was covering a collegue of mine who normally does that early morning shift was on holiday for a week so I had the privilege to do that for him/her which was a good thing.

This track is true classic by Daft Punk dating back 22 years ago and it really brings me back to my teenage years in 2001 back then."
